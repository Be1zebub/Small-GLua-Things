-- i think its fixed along time ago

-- from gmod.one with <3
-- https://github.com/Be1zebub/Small-GLua-Things/blob/master/deprecated/anti_steamid_spoof.lua

-- found exploit that allows to spoof a steamid
-- there is a way to steal a users token and use it to access any gmod servers under the steam ID of another user.
-- for example - with this exploit, an hacker can steal in-game valuables from other peoples accounts

-- This code fixes this problem, so I strongly recommend installing it on your server.
-- if you don't know how to install, just download this file in garrysmod/lua/autorun/server

-- thx to WayZer#0084 for the details & fix
-- more details about this exploit can be found in https:/discord.gmod.one (#helpful channel - you need to get developer role in #welcome for get access to this channel)
