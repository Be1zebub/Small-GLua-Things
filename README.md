# Small GLua things

A lot of helpful things there!  
Libs, Utils, Snippets, Examples & More!  
This is just a klondike for gmod developers!

## Project structure

• [/libs](/libs) - Klondike of glua libs.  
Most of it can be used outside of gmod (eg i use most of it in Luvit).

• [/libs/small](/libs/small) - Small, but useful things in some cases.

• [/libs/thirdparty](/libs/thirdparty) - List of links to my favorite thirdparty glua libraries.

• [/libs/thirdparty/patched](/libs/thirdparty/patched) - Thirdparty libs, but patched.

• [/examples](/examples) - Examples of solutions to various issues.  
Mostly is answers to questions asked by members of the GMod One <https://discord.gmod.one/> developers community.  
Education purpose only.

• [/utils](/utils) - Useful utilities.  
Eg - dark theme for wiki, grep in gmod console, benchmark lib, e.t.c  
Some of this things could get a separate repository or get into [/libs](/libs) - but they dont deserve it.

• [/snippets](/snippets) - useful snippets.  
Eg lua style guide, lua patterns collection.

• [/deprecated](/deprecated) - Unfinished/untested/outdated things.  
Its exists only for history/education purposes.

## TLDR

Each directory contains its own readme, which **may even** contain a more detailed description.
